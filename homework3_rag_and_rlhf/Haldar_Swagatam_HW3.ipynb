    "## Exercise 1: Building a retrieval-augmented generation system (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "An increasingly popular approach to language generation is so called *retrieval-augmented generation* (RAG) wherein a language model is supplied with additional (textual) information retrieved from some storage, in addition to the actual task query. It has been found that this additional context improves model performance, and, e.g., allows to use LLMs with custom information (e.g., proprietary documents etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general set up of a RAG system is as follows:\n",
    "1. Some form of a database (DB) with (searchable) relevant background information (e.g., a database, a set of documents, ...) is created.\n",
    "   1. A common database format are *vector DBs*, or, vectore stores. You can optionally learn more about vector DBs, e.g., here: https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/. The important conceptual point is that some form of a searchable database with relevant (textual) information is created.\n",
    "2. An LLM that will be generating the responses to the queries, given context, is chosen.\n",
    "3. An embedding model is chosen.\n",
    "4. Task queries (e.g., questions or instructions) are provided to the system.\n",
    "   1. The query is converted to an embedding (using the model chosen ins tep 3), and the embedding is used to search and retrieve relevant information from the database. The specific retrieval method depnds on the nature of the database.\n",
    "   2. The relevant information is supplied to the LLM as context.\n",
    "5. Given the extended context, the LLM provides output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is visualized in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](../tutorials/pics/basic_rag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image is sourced from [here](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/concepts/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on RAG, you can read the first part of [this](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/concepts/) blog post (until \"important concepts within each step\"). [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401) is an optional paper about RAG, in case you want to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASK**\n",
    "> Your task in this exercise is to explore RAG by implementing a RAG system for recipe generation. The implemented RAG system should be compared to the performance of the same model in a \"vanilla\" set-up where the model solves the task directly.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We will use the package `LlamaIndex` and the LLM `phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` model as the backbone for the implementation. We will use the `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` model as our embedding model.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We will use unstructured data in the form of a recipe dataset `m3hrdadfi/recipe_nlg_lite`. This dataset will be indexed and it will be used to supplement information for the LLM, additionally to the query. The train split of the dataset should be used for the index, and a sample from the test dataset will be used for sampling queries with which the system will be tested.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For this task, please complete the following steps:\n",
    "> 1. Download the dataset from Huggingface.\n",
    "> 2. Briefly familiarize yourself with the dataset.\n",
    "> 3. Briefly familiarize yourself with [this](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/starter_example_local/) LLamaIndex example RAG system.  \n",
    "> 4. Complete the code below (in place of \"### YOUR CODE HERE ####\"), following the instructions in the comments to build a working RAG system that will generate recipes. Note that you will have to work with the LlamaIndex documentation to complete and understand the code. Some links are already provided.\n",
    "> 5. Answer the questions at the end of the exercise."

    "> **Questions:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. Inspect the results of the testing. (a) How often do you prefer the RAG response over the vanilla response? (b) Do you observe differences between the RAG and vanilla responses? If yes, what are these? (c) Inpsect the retrieved documents and their scores. Do they make sense for the queries? Do the scores match your intuition about their relevance for the query?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) I would prefer RAG response over the vanilla response in all of the 5 cases above for reasons mentioned in part (b).\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Some differences I noted between the vanilla and RAG responses:\n",
    "- few vanilla responses are _empty_, i.e., the model did not generate anything which is a bit strange.\n",
    "- there are _repeated lines/sentences_ in few of the vanilla responses, whereas RAG responses are often coherent and compact.\n",
    "- vanilla responses are often _unstructured_, i.e., they list some steps but often incomplete, on the other hand, most RAG responses give some instructions first and then list the necessary ingredients required.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The retrieved documents are indeed relevant for the queries. Almost in all cases, the retrieved documents have scores greater than $0.75$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the query: `How do I make mussels in basil cream sauce?`, all 3 of the retrieved documents have high similarity ($0.80$, $0.79$ and $0.77$) and contain some recipe involving `mussels` as seen above, although not exactly the recipe for `mussels in basil cream sauce`. The model nicely improvised in this case to generate a similar looking recipe from the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. What could be advantages and disadvantages of using RAG? Name 1 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: RAG helps the model to generate the answer based on the provided context that might reduce the chance of hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage**: Often it is not possible to fit all documents in the model prompt (because of limited context size), hence there are different ways of combining the LLM's generated answers over multiple calls and this makes the system a little complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "> 3. What is the difference between documents and nodes in the RAG system?\n",
    "\n",
    "In LlamaIndex, a `Document` is a container object for a (large) text document, PDF or any other type of document. On the other hand, a `Node` is a smaller unit that is retrieved during the retrieval process, that has metadata associated with it. A big document might get chunked into multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "> 5. What does the embedding model do? What is the measure that underlies retrieval of relevant documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding model produces a compact numerical vector representation (_embedding_) for each document (provided for indexing). When a query comes, the same embedding model also produces the embedding for the query, and tries to find out most similar documents (embedding vectors) based on some similarity criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LlamaIndex, the default similarity measure is **cosine similarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "> 6. What are different response modes of the query engine? Is the chosen mode a good choice for our application? Why (not)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Often all the retrieved documents for a given query do not fit in a single call to the LLM because of limited context size. Response modes define how to combine LLM generations from many calls to provide the user with a final single answer to their query. The different response modes available are: `refine`, `compact`, `tree_summarize`, `accumulate`, `simple_summarize` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our application, the `compact` response mode was chosen that tries to fit as many documents/nodes in the prompt to minimize calls to the LLM. It looks like a good choice in this recipe application, because the documents/recipes are\n",
    "short (100-200 words) and the total context size of the model is $1024$, so it can easily accommodate 5-6 documents in the prompt.\n",

      "(CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now \"feeling well\" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \"I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.\" Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: \"We can't not be worried, it scares you each time.\" Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. \"He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems,\" Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. \"It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. \"It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks.\" Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January. Almost exactly three years ago at White Hart Lane, then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was near death,  according to Bolton, but survived after being treated at the London Chest Hospital. He subsequently retired. Other footballers, including Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe in 2003 and Spanish international Antonio Puerta in 2007, didn't survive after collapsing on the pitch.\n"

      "(CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied. That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. \"I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big,\" Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. \"Thanks for all the support and prayers,\" a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. \"I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger.\" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page. But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. So high, that it is taking five surgeons, a covey of physician assistants, nurses and anesthesiologists, and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people. They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients. \"The ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs, one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair,\" the medical center said in a statement. The chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up Friday. In late March, the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients. Here's how the super swap works, according to California Pacific Medical Center. Say, your brother needs a kidney to save his life, or at least get off of dialysis, and you're willing to give him one of yours. But then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him, and it's certain his body would reject it. Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died. Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him. Alternatively, you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say, two more siblings, where the donor's kidney isn't suited for his sister, the recipient. But maybe your kidney is a match for his sister, and his kidney is a match for your brother. So, you'd do a swap. That's called a paired donation. It's a bit of a surgical square dance, where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling. But instead of a square dance, Broussard's generous move set off a chain reaction, like dominoes falling. Her kidney, which was removed Thursday, went to a recipient, who was paired with a donor. That donor's kidney went to the next recipient, who was also paired with a donor, and so on. On Friday, the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain. Such long-chain transplanting is rare. It's been done before, California Pacific Medical Center said in a statement, but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time. That changed when a computer programmer named David Jacobs received a kidney transplant. He had been waiting on a deceased donor list, when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger. Jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills, creating MatchGrid, a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly. \"When we did a five-way swap a few years ago, which was one of the largest, it took about three to four months. We did this in about three weeks,\" Jacobs said. But this chain wouldn't have worked so quickly without Broussard's generosity -- or may not have worked at all. \"The significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients,\" said Dr. Steven Katznelson. \"Where there had been only three or four options, with the inclusion of the altruistic donor, we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients.\" And that's divine, Broussard's friend Shirley Williams wrote in a comment her on Broussard's Facebook page. \"You are a true angel my friend.\"\n"

    "*AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead* is a model class provided by `trl` that is used for **training models with RL with a *baseline*.** The baseline is used as shown, e.g., on slide 76-78 of lecture 05. Specifically, the baseline is simultaneously learned during training, and learns to predict the so-called action value, namely **the expected reward for generating a particular completion**, given the query. This baseline is implemented as an additional (scalar output) head next to the next-token prediction head of the policy, and is called the value head. Based on the query and completion representation, it learns to predict a scalar reward which is compared to the ground truth reward from the reward model."

       "\"Police are hunting for a 'dangerous' convicted killer who absconded from the accommodation where he was living while on probation. William Kerr, 53, was jailed for life in 1998 for the murder of 43-year-old Maureen Comfort, whose body was found in a cupboard in her flat in Leeds. He was released on licence from HMP Stocken, Rutland, on January 23 this year and moved to approved accommodation in Hull. On the run: Convicted killer William Kerr, 53, pictured, was jailed for life in 1998 for the murder of 43-year-old Maureen Comfort, whose body was found in a cupboard in her flat in Leeds. Kerr now needs to be arrested and returned to prison as 'a matter of urgency', police said, after he breached his licence conditions by absconding from his residence. Members of public are being asked not to approach Kerr if they see them, and instead to call the police immediately on 999. Kerr was jailed along with co-defendant Christopher Moody. According to court papers, Ms Comfort was last seen alive on December 4 1995. Relatives found her strangled body  on January 8 1996. Victim: The strangled body of Maureen Comfort, pictured, was found in a cupboard in her Leeds flat. The National Offender Management Service contacted North Yorkshire Police for assistance after Kerr absconded from approved premises in Hull. North Yorkshire Police are leading the search for Kerr as his probation officer is based in Selby, North Yorkshire, but a spokesman said there is no evidence to suggest he is in the county. Kerr is also known to have links to the Humberside, West Yorkshire and London areas, police said. Detective Inspector Eamonn Clarke, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'To assist our already extensive efforts to trace William Kerr, I am urging people to keep an eye out for the man in the photographs. 'We ask that you do not approach Kerr, as he is considered dangerous. You should contact the police straight away on 999 and officers will be despatched to arrest him or investigate the sighting.' Mr Clarke said he is also appealing directly to Kerr. The officer said: 'William, you know you have breached your licence conditions, and by continuing to do so you are only making things worse. 'It is now time to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police.' He urged anyone with information to call 999 and pass details to North Yorkshire Police stating the 'William Kerr appeal'. He said people\""

    "\n",
    "- **A**: looks like a non-aligned reference model as the range of rewards obtained is random and covers the entire range, so generated summaries are sometimes good, sometimes bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **B**: batch reward sadly decreases on ppo training, so maybe training is not effective, (perhaps regularization (on KL div from reference model) is too strong?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C**: reward goes up with steps, so the model is expected to generate summaries that are aligned with human preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. We have truncated the query articles to maximally 512 tokens. Given that **we are using ROUGE with respect to ground truth summaries** as a reward, why might this be problematic?\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy model might be tempted to complete the article rather than generating summary (even though it is finetuned to produce summaries). The ground truth summaries however were generated from the full article, so it is also perhaps a bit unfair to expect the model to generate good summaries from the truncated articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. [Bonus 2pts] The overall loss that is optimized during training with PPO consists of two components: the policy loss that is computed based on the completion log probability and the reward, and the value function loss which is computed based on the the predicted and received reward for a completion. These two loss components are weighed in the total loss function with the value function coefficient (`vf_coef`). Intuitively, how does it affect training if the coefficient is set to a high value?\n",
    "\n",
    "If `vf_coef` is set to a high value, the value function network would be forced to predict rewards as close as possible to the actual reward, and it might overfit to the reward model. For example, the policy might figure out ways to generate text that get high reward but it might no longer be aligned to what the human wanted as a response (reward hacking).\n",

    "> Please answer the following questions. Be concise!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. When assistants are trained with RLHF, they are often optimized to be helpful and harmless. However, it has been observed that **the goals of being harmless and helpful at the same time may be at odds**. In particular, the problem of evasive behavior has been observed for models optimized for these goals. For example, [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf) mentions this problem. In your own words, please briefly describe what evasive behavior of LLMs is, give an example, and why it is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Evasive behaviour of LLMs is when an LLM refuses to respond to a seemingly innocuous query, or avoids the topic completely proving a non-informative response to the user. A super helpful LLM might cause harm by generating a detailed response to inappropriate queries by a malicious user, such as \"How do I steal food from my neighbour?\", and hence being helpful and harmless at the same time may be at odds. However, the LLM simply saying \"I cannot help you with that.\" is also not desired, and is an example of evasive behaviour. Ideally, we would want the LLM to respond with some text on why it is socially unacceptable to steal and warn the user about legal consequences of the act, hence evasive behaviour is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My answer above is motivated from the following excerpt from paper:\n",
    "> _That is, helpfulness tends to increase harmfulness, since models are willing to obey pernicious requests, and conversely models trained to be harmless tend to be more evasive and generally less helpful. By harmfulness we include both a variety of forms of harm to the user and responses that help the user to achieve harmful aims._\n",

    "> 2. What special tokens are commonly used for chat model fine-tuning, and what is their purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "To specifically delineate the roles for users and assistants, some special tokens are used to inform the model where the user query is located, and also when should the assistant/chat LLM should begin its response. For example: `<|user|>` and `<|assistant|>` in the completion prompt in the RAG exercise. There are also special tokens to mark the beginning and end of user (or assistant) texts, such as `<|im_start|>`, and `<|im_end|>`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Selective fine tuning**: this PEFT method _freezes_ most of the layers in the base model and only updates few layers, e.g., the final two feedforward layers during finetuning with task specific data. This is advantageous over full finetuning as we do not have to update (hence also not necessary to store gradients) the frozen part and it reduces the (GPU) memory load.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt tuning**: this PEFT method tries to find out the optimal way of _asking_ a model to do a task, by appending few random vectors before the actual task prompt, and updating only those _soft prompt_ vectors during finetuning. Prompt tuning freezes the entire base model so it also have low memory overhead, but again for each task it requires a separate soft prompt to prepend to the task prompt.\n",
